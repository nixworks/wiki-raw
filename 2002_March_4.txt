*[[War in Afghanistan (2001â€“present)|2001 U.S. Attack on Afghanistan]]: Seven American [[Special Operations Forces]] soldiers are killed as they attempt to infiltrate the [[Shahi Kot Valley]] on a low-flying helicopter reconnaissance mission.  Around {{Nowrap|3 a.m.}} local time a [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook]] helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, causing a soldier to fall out and damaging a hydraulic line. The helicopter made an emergency landing a half-mile away. A second helicopter on the mission picked up the first helicopter's crew and flew to where the crew member had fallen. The soldiers soon came under heavy fire, and six were killed. The remaining soldiers returned fire and retrieved the bodies before returning to base.
