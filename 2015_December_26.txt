;Disasters and accidents
*[[2015–16 Australian bushfire season]]
**A [[Wildfire|bushfire]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] state  has destroyed 116 homes. The 2200-hectare [[Jamieson, Victoria|Jamieson Track]] blaze razed 98 homes in [[Wye River (Victoria)|Wye River]] and 18 at [[Separation Creek, Victoria|Separation Creek]].  The fire stopped just 500 meters short of [[Kennet River (Victoria)|Kennett River]].
