;Health and medicine
*The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] calls for pregnant women to abstain completely from alcohol during the entire three trimesters of the pregnancy, saying no amount of any type of alcohol should be considered safe since the risks, to the baby in particular (such as [[fetal alcohol syndrome]], among many others), are too great. This puts the U.S. alongside other Western developed countries- except [[Italy]] and the [[United Kingdom]], which still allow occasional small amounts- in urging complete abstinence. The [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), the two other U.S. agencies that comment most about this issue, already recommend total alcohol abstinence.
