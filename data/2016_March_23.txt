*[[2016 Brussels bombings]]
**[[Belgium|Belgian]] federal prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw  says two brothers of Belgian nationality, Khalid and Brahim el-Bakraoui, were responsible for yesterday's suicide bombings. Khalid bombed the subway station while Ibrahim bombed the airport, he added. A third suspect, who died at the airport, is identified as Najim Laachraoui, says ''[[De Standaard]]''.

;Business and economics
*The [[United States Department of Labor|U.S.  Labor  Department]] releases a long-awaited rule, the so-called persuader rule that was first proposed in 2011. The regulation requires companies to disclose when they seek advice about [[Opposition to trade unions|countering union campaigns]]. The final rule will apply to contracts beginning on July 1, 2016. Several business groups, such as the [[National Retail Federation]], the  [[Associated Builders and Contractors]], the [[United States Chamber of Commerce|U.S. Chamber of Commerce]] and the [[National Association of Manufacturers]],  object because the rule limits employers' free speech rights to counter union organizing, it could interfere with attorney-client privilege, etc. Court challenges are expected.

;International relations
*[[European migrant crisis]]
**[[Médecins Sans Frontières]] (Doctors Without Borders) and the  UN refugee agency, [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]], announce they are withdrawing from the so-called hotspots on the Greek islands because of the new EU-Turkey deal. UNHCR's Melissa Fleming says, "Under the new provisions, these sites (hotspots) have now become [[Immigration detention|detention facilities]]." MSF's Marie Elisabeth Ingres says, “We will not allow our assistance to be instrumentalized (sic) for a mass expulsion operation, and we refuse to be part of a system that has no regard for the [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] or protection needs of [[Refugee#Asylum_seekers|asylum seekers]] and [[Immigration|migrants]].” [http://www.vox.com/2016/3/23/11291612/eu-greece-refugee-inhumane (Vox Media)]  [http://neurope.eu/article/unhcr-msf-withdraw-hotspots-calling-prisons/ (''New Europe'')]

*The [[Supreme Court of the United States]], which currently has just [[Supreme Court of the United States#Current justices|eight justices]], today heard the case brought by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh]] (''Zubik v. Burwell'', which includes similar ones by other religious organizations) that challenges the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]  [[Contraceptive mandate (United States)|provision]] that employer-paid [[Health insurance in the United States|health insurance plans]] provide women with access to [[Birth control|contraceptives]] at no additional out-of-pocket cost, and challenges the  federal government accommodation offered in 2014 that would have a third-party provide the coverage with costs paid by the federal government. The plaintiffs state that both are  unconstitutional because they violate  the [[Free Exercise Clause|free exercise of religion]]. The decision is expected in June. If the result is a split decision (4-4), there would be no national precedent and [[Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States#Decision|each case's final decision would be the one made in court before the case was forwarded to the Supreme Court]]. In the group of cases presented today,  all but one appeals court upheld the government mandate.
