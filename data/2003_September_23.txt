* [[Iraq]]: A U.S.-led coalition-backed [[Iraqi Governing Council]] member, [[Ayad Allawi]], announces restrictions of the operations of TV networks [[al Jazeera]] and [[al-Arabiya]]. The networks are barred from reporting on official activities and news conferences and from entering ministries and office buildings for the next two weeks. The council claims they incited anti-occupation violence (by airing statements from resistance leaders; specifically broadcasting a video of "terrorists terrorizing Iraqis"), increased ethnic and sectarian tensions and were supportive of the lawless resistance. Allawi hopes the ban sends a "very clear message" to other stations.
