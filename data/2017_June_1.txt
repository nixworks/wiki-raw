*[[Gravitational-wave astronomy]]
**An announcement is made that the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory ([[LIGO]]) has made a third detection of [[gravitational waves]]. The signal, detected on 4 January 2017, apparently results from a [[Binary_black_hole#Lifecycle|merger]] of two [[black holes]] of 19 and 31 solar masses. Such detections are said to be progressively moving this emerging field in astronomy "from novelty to new observational science".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Amos|first1=Jonathan|title=Gravitational waves: Third detection of deep space warping|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-40120680|website=BBC|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Schirber|first1=Michel|title=Synopsis: LIGO Picks Up on the Third Ring|url=https://physics.aps.org/synopsis-for/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.221101|website=Physical Review Letters|publisher=American Physical Society|accessdate=1 June 2017}}</ref>
