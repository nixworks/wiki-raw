;Science and technology
*[[Netflix]] acknowledges it's been slowing its video transmission on [[Mobile network operator|wireless mobile carriers]] around the world, including [[Verizon Wireless|Verizon]] and [[AT&T Mobility|AT&T]], for five years to "protect consumers from exceeding mobile data caps."

The company told ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' that [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]] or [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] users weren't affected because, "historically those two companies have had more consumer-friendly policies." In May, Netflix plans to shift some of that control to viewers themselves.
