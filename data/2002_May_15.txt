* [[Politics of the Netherlands]]: General elections for the lower house of parliament were held. The [[Lijst Pim Fortuyn]] (LPF) was the great winner, the party gained 26 of the 150 seats, a historic achievement for a new party. The CDA ([[Christen Democratisch Appèl]]) led by [[Jan Peter Balkenende]] became the greatest party (43 seats). The great losers were the coalition parties of the ruling "purple coalition" ([[Dutch Labour Party|PvdA]], labour party; [[VVD]], liberals; [[D'66]], leftist liberals). These parties were diminished to half of their former size. [[Ad Melkert]] (PvdA) resigns as political leader of his party.
