**Astronomers observe the [[Cosmogony|birth]] of a [[Symbiotic binary|symbiotic X-ray binary]], a star [[Cosmic entity|system]] in which matter is transferred from a [[red giant]] star to a [[X-ray binary|closely orbiting]] [[neutron star]] (the remnant of a star gone [[supernova]]), forming an [[accretion disk]] and shining brightly in the X-ray. The object, IGR J17329-2731, flared brightly in the X-rays in August 2017. Further [[Scientific method|study]] showed it to be a symbiotic X-ray binary, suspected to be flaring for the first time, the neutron star being thus "brought back to life" by the red giant.
