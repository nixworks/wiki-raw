*The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC), the [[cancer]] agency of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), has evaluated the [[carcinogenicity]] of the consumption of [[red meat]] and [[processed meat]]. After thoroughly reviewing the accumulated scientific literature, a Working Group of 22 experts from 10 countries convened by the [[IARC Monographs Programme]] classified the consumption of red meat as probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A), based on limited evidence that the consumption of red meat causes cancer in humans and strong mechanistic evidence supporting a carcinogenic effect.

Processed meat was classified as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1), based on sufficient evidence in humans that the consumption of processed meat causes colorectal cancer.
