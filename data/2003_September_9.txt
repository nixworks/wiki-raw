* The name of Montreal Dorval International Airport is officially changed to [[Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport|Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport]]. The [[Montreal]] airport becomes the first major Canadian site to be renamed in honour of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau|Trudeau]]. The move sparks controversy among many in [[Quebec]] owing to Trudeau's political history, such as his decision to invoke the War Measures Act and send troops into Montreal during the [[October Crisis]] in 1970, and his construction of [[Montréal-Mirabel International Airport]], which they regard as a white elephant.
