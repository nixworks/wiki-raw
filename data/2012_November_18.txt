*[[Operation Pillar of Defense]]:
**An [[Israel]]i strike on a home in [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] has killed at least 10 people, officials say, as Sunday became the deadliest day since Israel launched an operation against [[Hamas]] militants last week. Over 80 Israeli alleged terrorist targets were hit today by [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] bombs including rocket firing sites and weapon smuggling tunnels. The IDF releases a video showing rocket launching sites adjacent to a [[Mosque]] and accuses [[Hamas]] of using [[human shields]].
