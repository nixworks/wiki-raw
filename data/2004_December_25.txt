* Portions of [[South Texas|South]] and [[Southeast Texas]] south of [[Interstate 10|I-10]] had their first White Christmas ever as snow was recorded falling from [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]] to [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]] with as much as {{convert|13|in|cm}} in [[Brazoria, Texas|Brazoria]]. The snowfall began on [[Christmas Eve]] as a deep layer of below freezing (below 32&nbsp;°F/0&nbsp;°C) temperatures settled across the region after the passing of an Arctic [[cold front]] and an upper level low pressure system crossed the region and dumped snow in its wake. Very little snow fell north of I-10 because of the lack of moisture further from the coast. [http://www.srh.noaa.gov/hgx/projects/xmasevesnow04.htm (National Weather Service)]
