**The [[United Nations]] and [[human rights group]]s warn the tentative EU deal with Turkey that would return [[Illegal immigration|irregular migrants]] in exchange for political and financial rewards could be illegal. [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees]] [[Filippo Grandi]] says it's unclear whether  migrants, set to be returned, would be afforded the refugee protection as stated in  international law. [[Amnesty International|Amnesty International's]] Gauri van Gulik says this is outsourcing Europe's refugee responsibility. "The EU is treating Turkey as the only solution it has to the refugee crisis," van Gulik added.[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-idUSKCN0WA1D4 (Reuters)] [http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-europe-turkey-migrants-20160309-story.html (''Los Angeles Times'')]

*[[Israel–Palestine relations]]
**A [[Pew Research Center]] survey of Jewish and non-Jewish Israelis, via face-to-face interviews from October 2014 through May 2015, finds deep divisions in Israeli society – not only between [[Israeli Jews]] and the country’s [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab citizen]] minority, but also among the religious subgroups that make up [[Israeli Jews#Growth|Israeli Jewry]].  An overwhelming majority (98%) of Israeli Jews agree all Jews should have the right to  [[Law of Return|move to Israel and receive immediate citizenship]]. Close to half (48 percent)  support the expulsion or transfer of Arabs from Israel, yet most secular Jews  disagree (58%) with this, as do 54 percent of those in the center politically (more so from the left). Meanwhile, Israeli Arabs,  currently about one-in-five of the country's adults, generally do not think Israel can be a Jewish state and a democracy at the same time. Fewer  Arabs (down 24 points) think a peaceful, two-state solution is possible, from 74% in 2013 to 50% now. Both groups are skeptical of the peace process: Israeli Arabs question the sincerity of the Israeli government in seeking a peace agreement, while Israeli Jews are equally skeptical about the sincerity of Palestinian leaders.

**[[President of Israel|Israeli President]] [[Reuven Rivlin]] says  the Pew study brings up troubling challenges that need to be dealt with immediately. The finding that 48 percent of Jewish Israelis believe Arabs should be transferred out of Israel is particularly troubling to Rivlin. [[List of Arab members of the Knesset|MK]] [[Yousef Jabareen]], chair of the [[Politics of Israel#Political centre|Knesset Lobby for Jewish-Arab Coexistence]], said, "The transfer of citizens, for whatever reason, is a crime against humanity, and I am frightened to see that half of those polled support such a step."  [[Human rights in Israel|Human rights organizations]], such as [[Amnesty International#National sections|Amnesty International Israel]] and the [[Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for the Dialogue Between Cultures|Anne Lindh Foundation's Association for the Advancement of Civic Equality in Israel]],  denounced [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] for the results of the study.
