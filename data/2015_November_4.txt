*[[Kunduz hospital airstrike]], [[Afghanistan War]]
**The [[United States Department of Defense|United States]] says that last month's airstrikes in [[Kunduz]] hit three locations, mistakenly including the [[Médecins Sans Frontières]]  (Doctors Without Borders) (MSF) hospital  where at least 30 were killed.  [[Afghan National Army|Afghan commanders]], whose forces were actively engaged  with the [[Taliban]], requested the attacks. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reports a warehouse and a mansion in two densely populated residential areas were "pulverized" without loss of civilian lives.  According to residents, earlier their neighborhoods had  been [[War|conflict zones]], but no militants were there the time of the attacks. "Together, the three attacks raise questions about the quality and reliability of the intelligence that Afghan security forces are providing to their American partners, as well as U.S. decisions to act on that intelligence," writes the Post.

**[[Médecins Sans Frontières]]   held memorials around the globe Tuesday, the one month anniversary of the bombing, to reaffirm their request for an independent investigation. [[United States|U.S.]] officials resist  an independent probe, pledging that the three investigations underway, by the [[United States Department of Defense|Pentagon]], [[NATO]], and [[Afghanistan|Afghan officials]], will be thorough and transparent. Thomas Nierle, head of MSF Switzerland, told [[Agence France-Press|AFP]] that he had little hope the inquiries would ultimately see any wrongdoers punished.
