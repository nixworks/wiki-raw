* [[2003 occupation of Iraq timeline|''Occupation of Iraq'']]: Poland assumes a position in postwar [[Iraq]]. The coalition in Iraq hands over the south-central part of the country to a force led by Poland. The force of Polish troops leads a multinational peacekeeping brigade that will relieve Coalition forces (in particular the United States [[Marine expeditionary force]]). This is Poland's biggest military operation since [[World War&nbsp;II]]. This is also the first sign of the global community's commitment to a postwar Iraq.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0903/p07s02-woeu.html|title=For the Washington-Warsaw alliance, a test in Iraq|author=The Christian Science Monitor|work=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,96288,00.html|title=U.S. Hands Over Partial Control of Iraq|work=Fox News|accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref> [[Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] seeks support from Britain, France, Germany, and Russia on a proposed [[United Nations]] resolution that would give the United Nations a role in [[Iraq]]'s [[economic]] and [[politics|politic]]al future.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/dailynews/246/wash/Powell_sounds_out_allies_on_U_%3A.shtml ]{{dead link|date=October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nynewsday.com/news/ny-uniraq0903,0,4084645.story?coll=nyc-topnews-short-navigation |title=www.nynewsday.com |publisher=www.nynewsday.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-24}}</ref>  Coalition [[soldier]]s strongly desire to see more troops from other nations share the work of occupation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asia.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&storyID=3378091|title=Business & Financial News, Breaking US & International News - Reuters.com|publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref>

* [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] minister [[Frank Fahy]] accuses US Immigration authorities at [[Shannon Airport]] of acting 'disgracefully' in turning back a group of 13 Irish musicians travelling to attend New York benefit concert to raise money for an Irish [[cancer]] victim in the United States for treatment. Ireland's [[2003 Eurovision Song Contest]] singer [[Mickey Joe Harte]], one of the singers refused entry, said they were told they needed no visas in their case. However, at Shannon, the musicians were suddenly told they needed [[work visa]]s, though the event was for charity and they were providing their services 'free of charge'. Irish people travelling to the United States do not normally need visas except to get paid employment. The concert is scheduled for Friday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/arts//2003/0903/harte.html|title=RTÉ Ten, The Entertainment Network, TV listings, Celebrity news, interviews, photos, videos, soaps, reviews, cinema, listings|date=17 October 2015|publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref>
* Miss Justice [[Mary Laffoy]] dramatically resigns as chairperson of the [[Laffoy Commission on Child Abuse]], which is investigating evidence of child sex abuse in schools, orphanages and Catholic Church-run institutions over decades in Ireland. Her resignation followed one day after the Minister for Education, [[Noel Dempsey]] told [[RTÉ|RTÉ Radio]] that the Irish Government, worried by suggestions that the investigation would last more than a decade and cost hundreds of millions of euro, wanted to restructure the investigation to examine only a sample of the 1800 cases being investigated. The government has delayed publishing Justice Laffoy's resignation letter. Abuse victim and crusader against abuse [[Christine Buckey]] calls for Dempsey's resignation. [[Colm O'Gorman]], of the child abuse charity ''[[One in Four]]'', and himself a prominent survivor of abuse, calls on [[Taoiseach]] [[Bertie Ahern]] to publish all correspondence relating to the resignation.<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/news/2003/0903/ABUSE.html ]{{dead link|date=October 2015}}</ref>
