* Disgraced <!-- That is a word universally applied to him. His reputation is such that he was booed by mourners at a funeral he attended, and even when he announced he has terminal cancer, many people still called for him to be jailed and "preferably die in jail"!!.--> Irish former [[Taoiseach]] [[Charles Haughey]] sells his historic home and estate, ''Kinsealy'', in north [[Dublin]] to a property developer for {{Nowrap|35 million}} euro. The former taoiseach, whose financial dealings and [[tax-evasion]] is the subject of a judicial inquiry and which have largely destroyed his reputation, bought the palatial mansion for £120,000 in the 1960s. Haughey, who is suffering from terminal [[prostate cancer]], will not be allowed to remain in the house as a sitting tenant for the rest of his life<!--Do not remove. Haughey having to move out of Kinsealy is like Washington having to move out of Mount Vernon. Irish people worldwide will be shocked (many delighted) to hear he is being forced to move, given his terminal cancer -->, a demand of his which scuppered past attempts to sell.
