Most of the 500 demonstrators were dispersed peacefully, but a crowd of [[demonstration (people)|demonstrators]] was blocking traffic on private property near the port and fail to disperse after police warnings. Oakland Police Chief said demonstrators also threw objects and bolts at them, and said the use of  weapons was necessary to disperse the crowd.

A dockworker spokesman reported Police gave two minutes to disperse, then did not move to arrest people, instead they opened fire. Demonstrators also claim though the rubber bullets were supposed to be shot at the ground, the Police took direct aim at them. Oakland police said 31 people were arrested at the port.

U.S. soldiers found eleven 25â€“[[gallon]] barrels and three 55-gallon chemical drums, hundreds of gas masks and chemical suits, along with large numbers of [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] and [[artillery]] rounds.

Some reports indicate that the chemicals found at the agricultural warehouse may turn out to be [[pesticide]]s. Further tests are planned in the United States.
