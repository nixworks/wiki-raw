*[[Concorde|Son of Concorde]]
**A new [[plane]] that would fly from [[London]] to [[New York]] in three hours has just received crucial funding. The aircraft, dubbed the ‘[[Concorde|Son of Concorde]]’, was proposed by [[Nasa]] and has just been given the go-ahead by US officials. QueSST could make its maiden voyage in 2021 if all goes according to plan. If so, it will halve the current [[travel]] time between [[London]] and [[New York]]. [[Nasa]] has been awarded £14.3 [[billion]] in the latest [[US]] budget, around £360 million more than last year – although it is not clear how much of this will fund production of the [[Son of Concorde]].
