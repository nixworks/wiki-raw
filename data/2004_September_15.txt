* [[China and the United Nations]]: For the 12th consecutive year, the [[UN General Assembly|General Assembly of the United Nations]] rejects a request for the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) to be represented in the [[United Nations]]. This reiterates the Assembly's position that [[UN General Assembly Resolution 2758|Resolution 2758]], which recognized the People's Republic of China rather than the [[Republic of China]] as the sole legitimate representative of "China", prevents Taiwan from being separately represented. The ROC's supporters argue that the resolution did not give the People's Republic the exclusive right to represent the people of Taiwan.

* [[South Africa]] decides to recognize the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] (SADR) because [[Morocco]] refuse to discuss the territory [[self-determination]]."''Once that process was stopped and Baker resigned and Morocco said its (sovereignty claim) was not negotiable, then we were left with no choice''" declared [[Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma]]. Recognition of the [[SADR]] by South Africa had been promised by [[Nelson Mandela]] in 1994, but had been postponed by pressures from other countries, as the United States, France or Palestine. [[Thabo Mbeki]] stated on a speech to the [[Pan-African Parliament]] that the international community should press for [[Western Sahara]]'s self-determination in the same way as it had done to end South Africa's [[apartheid]]. Morocco reacted recalling its ambassador in South Africa for consultations, considering the recognition "partial, surprising and inopportune".
