* [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction]]: The world continues to digest David Kay's report that finds very little evidence of [[Weapons of mass destruction]] in [[Iraq]], although the regime did intend to develop more weapons with additional capabilities. Such plans and programs appear to have been dormant, the existence of these were also concealed from the [[United Nations]] during the inspections that began in 2002. Weapons inspectors in Iraq do find clandestine "''network of biological [[laboratory|laboratories]]''" and a deadly strain of [[botulinum]]. The US-sponsored search for WMD has so far cost {{Nowrap|$300 million}} and is projected to cost around {{Nowrap|$600 million}} more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20031003-104756-7758r.htm|title=This story is no longer available - Washington Times|publisher=|accessdate=22 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etaiwannews.com/World/2003/10/05/1065322964.htm|title=Taiwan News Online|publisher=|accessdate=22 December 2015}}</ref>

* [[Wesley Clark|General Wesley Clark]] suggests that members of the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration may be liable to criminal charges in connection with the [[Iraq]] war.  Clark alleges that the plans for the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], and other interventions in the [[Middle East]] (possibly including [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]]), pre-dated the inauguration of the President and that the reasons for the war were misleadingly presented to the US people.

* Polish soldiers of the United States-led Coalition discovered four advanced [[missile]]s around central [[Iraq]] in the Hilla region near a highway. The [[Roland missile|Roland-type]] French-made missiles (which are fired from a [[mobile launcher vehicle]] against low flying aircraft) were initially believed to have been manufactured earlier in 2003. [[Arms export]]s to Iraq had been barred by the United Nations after the 1990 invasion of [[Kuwait]]. France says it last shipped Roland missiles to Iraq in 1986. The Polish soldiers were later found to have misinterpreted markings that read 07-01-KND 2003 as a date on the missiles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thescotsman.co.uk/index.cfm?id=1099272003|title=Polish troops discover four French missiles in Iraq|publisher=|accessdate=22 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/middleeast/view/50640/1/.html|title=Channel NewsAsia|work=Channel NewsAsia|accessdate=22 December 2015}}</ref><ref name="reuters2">{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&storyID=3558401|title=Breaking News, Top News & Latest News Headlines - Reuters.com|publisher=|accessdate=22 December 2015}}</ref>
