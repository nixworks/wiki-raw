;Business and economy
*American [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] [[Pfizer]] and [[Allergan, Plc]] announce plans to merge to form the world's largest drug company. The merger is subject to approval from regulators in the [[United States|U.S.]], [[European Union]] and elsewhere as well as approval by [[shareholder]]s of both companies.

**A [[Washington University in St. Louis]] (U.S.) international tax law expert says this deal is the biggest merger involving [[tax inversion]], i.e., relocation of a corporation's [[Domicile (law)|legal domicile]] to a lower-tax nation,  usually while retaining  operations in its higher-tax country. "None  of the special anti-inversion laws and regulations issued by the federal government will apply to Pfizer post-merger," Professor Adam Rosenzweig, JD, said. Rosenzweig believes this deal will encourage more U.S. companies to follow Pfizer's approach in future mergers.

;Science and technology
*A new [[United Nations]] report finds 90 percent of the thousands of disasters over the last two decades  are weather-related. The majority have been caused by floods, storms, heatwaves and droughts. Researchers with the [[United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction|United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction]] (UNISDR) suggest the cost has been  between $250 and $350 billion per year, i.e., total of $5 trillion/$7 trillion.

Flooding, in particular, is becoming more frequent and more devastating as sea levels continue to rise.
