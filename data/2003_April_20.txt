* A bench clearing brawl happens in a [[baseball]] game between the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] and the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. Tino Martinez was hit by a 1–0 pitch from Miguel Batista, and took first base. He was then forced out at second base during the next batter's at-bat. When heading back to the dugout, Martinez charged Batista from behind. Batista turned and threw the ball at him, and players from both teams joined the altercation. The Diamondbacks ultimately won the game, 1–0, and the [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] suspends Martinez for four games, and Batista for ten.
