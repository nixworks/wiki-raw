* A [[Brazilian Space Agency]] [[VLS-1]] space rocket explodes on its launch-pad at [[Alcântara Launch Center|Alcântara space base]], killing at least 21 people. It is thought that one of the rocket's four motors caught fire; the subsequent explosion destroyed the rocket, its cargo of two satellites, and the launch-pad, as well as the deaths of many of Brazil's space-specialists, causing an estimated US${{Nowrap|12 million}} worth of damage. This ends Brazil's third attempt since 1997 at becoming a space power.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=LD3YB2PO413JUCRBAEKSFFA?type=topNews&storyID=3324417 ]{{dead link|date=September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3175131.stm |title=Americas &#124; Fatal blast hits Brazil space hopes |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-08-23 |accessdate=2015-09-26}}</ref>
