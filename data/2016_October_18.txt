;Science and technology
*[[Applications of nanotechnology]]
**While attempting to create a [[nanotechnology]]-based, [[catalyst]]-mediated series of chemical reactions to turn [[carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide ({{chem|C|O|2}})]] (a [[greenhouse gas]]) into a usable [[fuel]], scientists at the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]’s [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] instead discover a single-step process using the surface area of tiny spikes of [[copper]] and [[carbon]] as a catalyst to turn carbon dioxide into [[ethanol|ethanol ({{chem|C|H|3|C|H|2|O|H}})]]. The reaction may serve as a method to alleviate possible [[climate change]] by both decreasing {{chem|C|O|2}} in the [[atmosphere]] and by using the ethanol as an additive to fuels to increase efficiency and thereby decrease consumption.
