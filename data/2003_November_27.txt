* At the end of the First Count of elections to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], and reflecting the early [[Tally marks|tallies]] the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] attracts the highest popular vote, with [[Sinn Féin]] coming second, the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] third and the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party|SDLP]] fourth. Minor parties like the [[Progressive Unionist Party]], the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]] and the [[UK Unionist Party]] suffer major collapse, with the [[Northern Ireland Women's Coalition|Women's Coalition]] losing all its seats. Later counts are expected to boost the middle ground UUP and SDLP, who show greater possibilities of picking up inter-party transfers than the more extreme DUP and Sinn Féin. Nevertheless, Sinn Féin is widely expected to have more [[Legislative Assembly|MLAs]] than the SDLP, a reversal of the results in the 1998 Assembly elections. It is too close to call whether the previous larger UUP or the Rev. [[Ian Paisley]]'s DUP will have more seats after all counts. The final results will not be known until late on Friday, when all six seats in each [[constituency]] are filled. The election was held under [[Proportional Representation using the Single Transferable Vote|PR.STV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/3242504.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - Northern Ireland - Counting continues in NI poll|publisher=|accessdate=22 December 2015}}</ref>

* Larry Spencer of the [[Canadian Alliance]] party makes public statements stating his desire to recriminalize [[homosexual]] behaviour in Canada to combat what he claimed was a conspiracy by the homosexual community to infiltrate social institutions to recruit children into the "homosexual lifestyle". He was quickly denounced by numerous public figures including his own party leader, [[Stephen Harper]], who also made him resign his position as Family Issue Critic in the [[Canadian House of Commons]] with an apology. However, commentators have noted that these inflammatory homophobic statements have placed the pending vote on the proposed merger with the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] on December 6 in jeopardy by illustrating fundamental differences between the parties concerning social attitudes.
