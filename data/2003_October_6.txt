* [[SCO v. IBM Linux lawsuit|SCO v. IBM]]: In an open letter to the [[Linux]] community published by [[Silicon Graphics]] (SGI), SGI states it conducted a comprehensive comparison of the [[Linux kernel]] and the [[UNIX System&nbsp;V]] [[source code]] owned by The [[SCO Group]].

* [[American occupation of Iraq|Occupation of Iraq]]: Some in the international community have rejected a revised United States draft [[United Nations Security Council resolution]]  concerning [[Iraq]] (calling for a multinational force of peacekeeping troops in Iraq under American command; transferring power gradually to elected civilian rule [though there is no handover timetable for sovereignty]). The resolution is being supported by the United Kingdom. France, Germany, and Russia (which opposed the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]) have joined [[Kofi Annan]] in opposing the resolution. Annan states that the [[United Nations]] itself will not become heavily involved unless there are early moves toward passing sovereignty to the Iraqi people. Annan's stance is similar to that of [[Pope John Paul&nbsp;II]] and some members of the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/article_1050.shtml|title=FinalCall.com News|publisher=|accessdate=22 December 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ajc.com/news/content/news/ap/ap_story.html/Intl/AP.V6661.AP-UN-Iraq.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051130040148/http://www.ajc.com/news/content/news/ap/ap_story.html/Intl/AP.V6661.AP-UN-Iraq.html |date=November 30, 2005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wishtv.com/Global/story.asp?S=1470372|title=Story of my Life|work=WISH-TV|accessdate=22 December 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.voanews.com/article.cfm?objectID=55C8D482-E130-4E0F-88E43A2F02B92964] {{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>[http://www.swisspolitics.org/en/news/index.php?section=int&page=news_inhalt&news_id=4312369] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051203033556/http://www.swisspolitics.org/en/news/index.php?section=int&page=news_inhalt&news_id=4312369 |date=December 3, 2005 }}</ref>
* Attempts by the [[Republic of Ireland]]'s government to ban smoking in [[public house|pubs]], restaurants and hotels run into more trouble as a government minister who will have responsibility for enforcing the ban, [[Frank Fahey]], refuses to deny that he is critical of the plan and wants a compromise that would allow smoking in some areas to continue. A former [[Mayor of Galway]] and [[Fianna Fáil]] councillor who has links with the pub industry resigns from a health authority in protest at the refusal of the Fianna Fáil-[[Progressive Democrats|Progressive Democrat]] government to compromise on the proposed ban. This follows an earlier announcement that publicans in [[County Kerry]] will refuse to obey the new law and indications of growing popular opposition to the ban.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2003/1006/tobacco.html|title=Health board chief quits over smoking ban|date=6 October 2003|work=RTE.ie|accessdate=22 December 2015}}</ref>
