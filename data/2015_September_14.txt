;Health and medicine
*The [[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] issues a recommendation stating that, in consultation with their doctor and pharmacist, and provided the risk of [[gastrointestinal bleeding]] and the very rare risk of certain [[hemorrhagic stroke]]s do not outweigh the benefits in individual cases, that people aged 50 to 70 (especially those aged 50-60 and with a 10 percent risk or higher of [[cardiovascular disease]], or CVD; mindful that the risk of bleeding, which can be dangerous, goes up as one ages) should take low-dose aspirin, for a period of at least 10 years, for preventive benefits against CVD and [[heart attack]], as well as [[colorectal cancer]]. The evidence is inconclusive for those not at very high risk who are over 70, and below 40, and there is only weak evidence for prevention of [[lung cancer]], [[breast cancer]], and [[prostate cancer]].
