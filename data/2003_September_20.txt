* [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]]: [[Israel]] says that the [[United Nations]] resolution on [[Yasser Arafat]] (passed 133â€“4 with 15 abstentions) "is meaningless. It is only a declaration and not legally binding." Yasser Arafat states it is of the "utmost importance" as a sign of international support for the Palestinians.
