;Law and crime
*[[March 2017 Île-de-France attacks]]
**French security forces shoot suspect Ziyed Ben Belgacem dead in [[Paris]]' [[Orly Airport]] after he put the pellet gun to her head and took away an assault rifle from one of three soldiers from [[Opération Sentinelle|"Sentinelle" operation]] patrolling the airport.  Airport security temporarily evacuates about 3,000 people from the terminal. Police had flagged the fugitive man for suspected radicalism. Belgacem had earlier that day shot a police officer with a pellet gun after he was pulled over for speeding with his headlights off north of Paris. Later, he had threatened a bar and then carjacked another vehicle to the airport. Authorities are investigating the attack as a "possible" act of terrorism, but the motive is unclear as the suspect's father says Belgacem did not pray, was not a terrorist, and fell under the influence of the drugs and alcohol which were also found in subsequent autopsy.
