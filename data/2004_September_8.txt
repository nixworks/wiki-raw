* [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. presidential election]]:
** The National Board of the [[Log Cabin Republicans]] votes 22â€“2 against endorsing [[George W. Bush]], citing his support for a [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] amendment to [[Federal Marriage Amendment|define marriage in the U.S.]]  The LCR is the largest group of [[homosexuality|gay men and lesbians]] in the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]].

** US Democrats and Republicans wrangle over [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]]'s remarks about [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] candidate [[John Kerry]] and [[terrorism]]. Cheney originally said, "It's absolutely essential that eight weeks from today, on Nov. 2, we make the right choice, because if we make the wrong choice then the danger is that we'll get hit again and we'll be hit in a way that will be devastating from the standpoint of the United States." The Kerry campaign interpreted this remark as a claim that, if John Kerry was elected, America would be hit by a devastating terrorist attack. The next day, Cheney told the ''Cincinnati Enquirer,'' "I did not say if Kerry is elected, we will be hit by a terrorist attack." Democrats contend that Cheney's original statement reveals that Republicans "have consciously adopted a strategy of using Americans' justifiable fear of a future terrorist attack as a political tool." Democratic VP candidate [[John Edwards]] says that Cheney's remark shows that he and Bush "will do anything and say anything to save their jobs".

** CBS News announces the discovery of newly uncovered records of [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s service in the [[Air National Guard]]. These documents are known as the ''[[Killian memos]]''. The Democratic campaign concludes (1) that the records show then Lieutenant Bush disobeyed orders, and (2) that the Bush campaign lied about having made all such records public. [http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/B/BUSH_NATIONAL_GUARD?SITE=TNNAT&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT (Nashville Tennessean/AP)]  Within hours, several bloggers question the authenticity of the memos, which prove to be modern forgeries produced with Microsoft Word rather than historic documents made on a typewriter;  nevertheless, the documents heightened awareness of facts related tangentially to the memo, including that President Bush avoided duty in Vietnam at a time in which avoidance of such service was both highly in demand and difficult to obtain.
