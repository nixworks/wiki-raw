* [[War on Terrorism]]: An exclusive [[BBC]] report says a joint United States, Russia and United Kingdom "sting" halted a plot to shoot down [[Air Force One]] using an [[9K38 Igla|Igla]] surface-to-air missile. According to the BBC, the plot, initially unearthed by the Russians, led President [[Vladimir Putin]] to request that an [[FBI]] agent go to [[Saint Petersburg]], where the agent posed as an Islamic extremist and met the British arms dealer supplying the missile. The missile was shipped from Saint Petersburg to [[Baltimore]] in the United States. The British arms dealer "arranging" the deal was arrested when he arrived in [[Newark, New Jersey]], in the United States today. The White House has publicly denied that Air Force One was to be the target of the missile. However [[Tom Mangold]], the BBC veteran investigative reporter who broke the story, claims the British dealer supplying the missile recommended to the undercover FBI agent that the President's jet, rather than a commercial jet, be the target, saying that he could get another 60 Ingla missiles which could then be used to launch a co-ordinated attack on Air Force One.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3146025.stm |title=Americas &#124; Briton arrested in 'terror missile' sting |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-08-13 |accessdate=2015-09-26}}</ref>
