* [[SCO v. IBM Linux lawsuit]]: [[Novell]] enters the lawsuit between the [[SCO Group]] and [[International Business Machines|IBM]] with a press release concerning the SCO Group's ownership of [[Unix|UNIX]]. "To Novell's knowledge, the 1995 agreement governing SCO's purchase of UNIX from Novell does not convey to SCO the associated copyrights," a letter to the SCO Group's [[CEO]] [[Darl McBride]] said in part. "We believe it unlikely that SCO can demonstrate that it has any ownership interest whatsoever in those copyrights. Apparently you share this view, since over the last few months you have repeatedly asked Novell to transfer the copyrights to SCO, requests that Novell has rejected."
