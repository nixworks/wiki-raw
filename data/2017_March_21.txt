;Armed conflicts and attacks
*Citing security concerns because of recent terrorist activity, the [[Federal government of the United States|American]] and [[Government of the United Kingdom|British]] governments impose a ban affecting inbound-passengers flying from much of the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa]]. The ban includes airplane cabin passenger-accessible items such as [[laptop]]s,  [[Tablet computer|tablets]], and other electronic devices which are larger than a [[smartphone]]. Larger such electronic devices will still be allowed on board in [[checked baggage]] which is thus more closely screened and passenger-inaccessible.

;Law and crime
*In a 6&ndash;2 decision (''[[2016 term opinions of the Supreme Court of the United States|NLRB v. SW General, Inc]]''), the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] puts new restrictions on presidential powers, limiting a president's authority to staff certain top government posts in a case involving an appointment to the [[National Labor Relations Board]] saying that under the [[Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998|Federal Vacancies Reform Act]], a person cannot serve as the acting head of a federal agency once the president nominates him or her to permanently serve in the role if it is a position that requires [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] confirmation. The court upholds a lower court's ruling that then-President [[Barack Obama]] exceeded his legal authority with his temporary appointment of an NLRB general counsel in 2011. The ruling will give President [[Donald Trump]] and future presidents less flexibility in filling jobs that require [[Advice and consent|Senate confirmation]].
