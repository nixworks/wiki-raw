*[[European migrant crisis]]
** [[European Union]] leaders offer [[Turkey]] a detailed package of cash and incentives to agree that all [[Immigration|migrants]] attempting to cross the [[Aegean Sea]] by raft or boat would be sent back to Turkey which, in effect, becomes the region's migrant holding center. A number of stumbling blocks remain, such as raising the amount of aid from 3 billion euros to at least 6 billion euros; reducing the "72 arduous conditions" the Turks must meet to implement [[Visa requirements for Turkish citizens|visa-free travel for Turkish citizen]]s;  Europe agrees to  accelerate talks with [[Politics_of_Turkey#Executive|Ankara]] on its EU bid; etc.  [[Human Rights Watch]] protests the proposed  fast-track collective expulsions that fail to take individual circumstances into account and breach peoples' [[Refugee law|right to seek asylum]].

**[[European Union]] and [[Turkey|Turkish]] officials agree on how to handle  the flood of refugees. The deal, to return irregular migrants to Turkey, includes  acceleration of the country's long-stalled bid for membership in the union; billions of euros in extra aid, 3 billion euros now, another 3 billion by 2018; and, visa-free travel for Turks once the country satisfies the EU criteria. Europe will be taking in thousands of [[Syria]]n refugees directly from Turkey. [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] (Doctors Without Borders) strongly condemns the deal as "ugly and illegal." The agreement is set to go into effect  Sunday, March 20, 2016.

;Health and medicine
*[[Switzerland|Swiss]] research,  published in the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'', found that [[paracetamol]] -- sold as [[Tylenol (brand)|Tylenol]] and as a generic, acetaminophen,  in the United States -- was not effective at reducing pain or improving movement in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. The analysis examined 74 randomly-selected trials published between 1980 and 2015 with 58,556 patients who had osteoarthritis. The study did find the prescription drug [[diclofenac]], sold in the U.S. as Cataflam or Voltaren,  is the most effective [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAID]] available. [[McNeil Consumer Healthcare]], the makers of Tylenol, disagree with the study's conclusions.
