;Disasters and accidents
*All 955 [[South Africa]]n miners, who were stuck in the Beatrix gold mine  near  [[Welkom#Gold and uranium|Welkom]] in central [[Free State (province)|Free State province]] since Wednesday, have been brought to the surface.  Earlier,  65 other workers were  rescued. No serious injuries have been reported.
