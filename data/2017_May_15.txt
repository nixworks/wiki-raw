*The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] [[2016 term opinions of the Supreme Court of the United States|rules]] that the [[North Carolina]] state legislative members do not have standing to request an appeal of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] ruling against a law which barred unidentified voters from the ballet. Although the high court's ruling has nothing to do with the merits of previously enacted law, nevertheless, the overall outcome of the high court's narrow decision is to prohibit the voter identification requirement. Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] wrote a [[North Carolina v.

Roberts in his statement cited a "blizzard of filings over who is and who is not authorized to seek review in this court under North Carolina law."
