*The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] [[2016 term opinions of the Supreme Court of the United States|rules]] that the [[North Carolina]] state legislative members do not have standing to request an appeal of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] ruling against a law which barred unidentified voters from the ballot. The Supreme Court's decision makes no explicit judgements on the previous law, but the decision's outcome nevertheless prohibits the voter identification requirement. In his statement, Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] wrote that the move not to hear the case should not be interpreted as commenting on the law's merit, noting that one reason for not hearing it was a dispute over who represented the state – referencing a "blizzard of filings over who is and who is not authorized to seek review in this court under North Carolina law."
