*The remains of surrealist painter [[Salvador Dalí]] are exhumed following a Madrid court order on settling the paternity claim of a woman who is allegedly the painter's natural daughter. Various experts contest the claim, ranging from Dalí's sexual eccentrism (including a public boast about his "impotency") to the action being against the state (Dalí bequeathed his estate to Spain). If proven, his daughter could assume part of Dalí's estate. [http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40677828 (BBC News)]
