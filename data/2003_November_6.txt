* The United States will focus its [[foreign policy]] on bringing democracy to all peoples of the [[Middle East]]. In a major policy speech, [[President of the United States|US President]] [[George W. Bush]] states that some states people of the region should have responsible democratic leaders, announcing a new American "forward strategy of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] in the Middle East." Bush states a failure to establish democracy in Iraq would embolden [[terrorism|terrorists]] around the world, increase the danger to the US, and extinguish the hopes of millions in the region. "Our commitment to democracy is being tested in the Middle East," Bush states. He describes democratic reforms in the region as the next great turning point and blames decades of post-colonial Western foreign policy for allowing the many [[dictatorship]]s and violent [[theocracy|theocracies]] to develop. "As long as the Middle East remains a place where freedom does not flourish," Bush states, "it will remain a place of stagnation, resentment and violence ready for export. And with the spread of [[weapon]]s that can bring catastrophic harm to our country and to our friends, it would be reckless to accept the [[status quo]]."<ref>http://www.heraldsun.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5478,7799135%5E663,00.html</ref><ref>[http://www.islamonline.net/English/News/2003-11/06/article12.shtml ]{{dead link|date=October 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/11/07/bush.mideast.ap/ ]{{dead link|date=October 2015}}</ref>

* In the United Kingdom, the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] issues a denial of an unspecified allegation whose publication has been prohibited by court injunction granted against the ''Mail on Sunday'' [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspaper. The injunction had been granted to one former Royal Aide, but earlier today ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper had been granted permission to name a person who had sought an injunction. Sir [[Michael Peat]], the Prince's [[Private Secretary]] who issues the Prince's statement, attacks the person who had made the original allegation now subject to a court injunction, describing him as someone "who, unfortunately, has suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and has previously suffered from alcoholism following active service in the Falklands" and who has a history of making wild allegations which when investigated by police were found to be untrue. Peat says the country has been awash with rumours on the issue for the last week and that the Prince's statement was intended to kill off the unfounded speculation. The Prince's [[Royal Household|Household]] was previously embroiled in allegations of [[homosexual]] [[rape]] involving a staff member, amid the allegation that the Prince failed to take appropriate action against the person who allegedly committed the offence. Though details of the incident are not clear, they appear to involved the alleged witnessing of a male royal in bed with a male servant.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3249031.stm |title=UK &#124; Prince Charles denies 'ludicrous' claims |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-11-07 |accessdate=2015-10-24}}</ref><ref>[http://www.itv.com/news/1590218.html ]{{dead link|date=October 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2003510556,00.html ]{{dead link|date=October 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.throneout.com/viewstory.asp?STORY_ID=108 ]{{dead link|date=October 2015}}</ref>
