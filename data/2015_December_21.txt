**The [[European Union]] extends [[Russia]]n sanctions for interference in [[Ukraine]] another six months, until 31 July 2016.

*[[Spanish general election, 2015]]
**In Sunday's elections, [[Spain|Spain's]]  center-right ruling [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP) wins 123 seats (35.1%), and the center-left [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) takes 90  (25.7%) of the 350 seats in parliament, thereby ending Spain's two-party  system since neither  major party won an absolute majority. Turnout was 73 percent. Spain's  new political forces, [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] and [[Citizens (Spanish political party)|Ciudadanos]] (C's), get 69 and 40 seats, respectively. Smaller parties split the remaining 28 seats, 17 to [[Catalonia]] parties which favor [[Catalonia#21st_Century|secession]]. It appears that a coalition government will be necessary. PSOE has declined to join the PP, which actually doesn't want that either.
