* Sections of a '[[dodgy dossier]]' issued by the UK government, which purported to present the latest British intelligence about [[Iraq]], and which had been cited by [[Tony Blair]] and [[Colin Powell]] as evidence for the need for war, were criticized as plagiarisms.  They had been copied without permission from a number of sources including ''[[Jane's Intelligence Review]]'' and a 12-year-old doctoral thesis of a Californian student that had been published in the US journal ''[[Middle East Review of International Affairs]]''. Some sentences were copied word-for-word, and spelling mistakes had been reproduced from the original articles. Downing Street responded by saying that the government had never claimed exclusive authorship and that the information was accurate.
